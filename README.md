# ES6 JavaScript
A collection of commands and ES6 focused snippets for optimizing modern JavaScript development productivity.

# Note:
This is a fork of `atom-es6-javascript` by @hharnisc which in turn was a fork of `turbo-javascript` by @extrabacon.
The only reason for forking this wonderful project was the difference in styling between me and the original author.
Namely I prefer single quotes and no space between function and parentheses. That's it.
